- through out this project use antd and its rules spcifed in andt-rules.txt
- use tailwdincss with it's premitives 
- don't style antd components  
- just make littre changes and iterate 
- don't install anything
- use types instead of interface
- allways follow this structure when defining a component : export default function LoginForm({ onSubmit, loading = false }: LoginFormProps)
- don't use antd typography use just normal html like for title just use h1 or h2 and for text use p
